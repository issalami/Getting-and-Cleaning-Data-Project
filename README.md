# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repo contains project files from the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.


The source data which can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone which was used to explore the development in wearable technology.


This repository contains the following files:

1. CodeBook.md, the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed on the source data.

2. run_analysis.R, an R script which outlines the code transformations that was carried out.

3. tidy_data.txt, the resulting tidy data from the analysis.
